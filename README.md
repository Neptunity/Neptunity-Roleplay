# How to install?
If you already have a working 1.12.2 forge then you can skip this step. 
You need Java for this to work. 
First, create a 1.12.2 installation on your local desktop. 
Run the .jar file and install forge with the included installer.
Make sure you close all your open minecraft instances and launcher. 
Restart the launcher and if you don't see a 1.12.2 forge installstion
then create one.
